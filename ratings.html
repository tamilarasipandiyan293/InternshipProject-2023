I got my wedding cake from Patty’s Cakes and it was absolutely amazing. The tasting was so delicious and they let you choose flavor combinations which was so fun. They are so kind and helpful and made the entire process so smooth and easy. The cake looked and tasted beautiful and I will absolutely be using them for many events to come! Highly Recommend!

The cake we ordered was amazing and tasted even better. It was 3 layers, 2 layers of banana cake with strawberry jelly and strawberry mousse and 1 layer was chocolate with Oreo mousse. We loved our cake tasting and the experience was amazing.

Easiest Part of Wedding Planning. My husband worked with Patty’s to get the cake for our engagement party, and we knew we wanted them to provide our wedding cake too! The process and booking for the cake tasting was super easy, there are a ton of combinations but we ended up choosing lemon cake with raspberry filling. We added our own flowers and the cake came out beautifully, and we got tons of compliments on how delicious the cake was. Service was excellent, would definitely recommend for any big occasion!

Patty’s Cakes & Desserts made our wedding cake and EVERYONE loved it. People remarked on how delicious it was, not overly sweet, moist, and hit the spot. The team obviously is very experienced and was prepared from the beginning with a clear process of picking the flavors and designing the cake. We would highly recommend this company!

Patty’s Cakes was one of the recommended vendors for desserts at our wedding venue, the Heritage Museum of Orange County. It was amazing! All the flavors that we tried were so very delicious. Picking between the flavor combination was the hardest thing to decide.

We decided to go with a yamaha design, a chocolate cake with Oreo and chocolate chip filling.

The cake was beautifully decorated and we added some flowers to spruce it up even more! Everyone kept saying how delicious it was. I wish I would’ve had more too. We will definitely stop by to get some cupcakes soon and celebrate our month-a-versary!
